# What is Coucal?

Coucal is a platform for semantic linking and publishing of events, actions
and resources. Coucal is based on open standards for interoperability, and
prioritised information exchange with other tools and platforms.

## Events

Resource scheduling, availability and event planning are key functions of Coucal.

## Actions

Tasks and action tracking

## Resources

Contacts, resources and groups

## Annotations

Journaling and annotations

## What Coucal is not

Coucal is not intended to be a repository of (non-temporal) data itself, but rather to provide
links to the data residing in other tools and platforms. Coucal is primarily focused on temporal
and location-sensitive data such as events, annotations, availability, actions, etc.
