# Coucal API

The Coucal API is designed to be simple to use and adapt to your needs.

## REST-ful Verbs

The HTTP verbs used to access the Coucal API are as follows:

* POST - create a new resource, or a new version of an existing resource (where versioning is supported)
* PUT - replace an existing resource with a completely different resource
* PATCH - update an existing resource without creating a new version (this is idempotent)
* GET - retrieve an existing resource or list of resources
* DELETE - remove an existing resource
