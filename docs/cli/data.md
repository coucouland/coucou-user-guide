# Coucal CLI - Data Management

Data management commands use a virtual path to specify the location of the content. The virtual path is defined
as follows:

    /<workspace>/<repository>/<component>/<subcomponent>

Any sub-path is also valid for all commands as long as it follows the above hierarchical convention.

Data management commands include:

* List - list content at the specified path
* Move - move content to a destination path
* Read - read content at the specified path
* Write - write content to the specified path
* Delete - delete content at the specified path
