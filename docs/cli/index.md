# Coucal - Command Line Interface

Coucal includes a command line interface (CLI) for managing the structure and content of data.

The Coucal CLI provides management of three distinct functions: server bootstrap, configuration management,
and data management.

## Server Bootstrap

[Bootstrap commands](server.md) are used to start and stop Coucal server instances that service requests for API
and channel endpoints.

## Configuration Management

[Configuration commands](configuration.md) support management of repositories, workspaces, workflows, etc.

## Data Management

[Data commands](data.md) are used to read and write content to repositories as an alternative to the equivalent API
endpoints.
