## Calendar Management

Whether you use MS Outlook, Google or some other calendaring tool, you probably find that managing
meetings and appointments requires some level of dedication and skill to maintain an effective and
manageable schedule.

Coucal can connect directly with your calendar server to manipulate your calendars either manually
or via automation rules to maintain a healthy schedule. You can also use queries to extract information
from your calendars to gain clarity and insights from an often busy schedule.


## Work Tracker

Tasks and workflows are often managed via different tools depending on the context. For example, you
may use something like JIRA for work and project management, but at home you might use something like
Wunderlist or Trello.

Coucal is capable of synchronising with configured workflow and task management
applications, and even act as a bridge between these tools.


## Journaling

If we think of journaling today it is typically associated with a blog, but sometimes we have a need to
journal items that we would like to remain private, or share with a limited audience. For this purpose
you may be using tools such as Evernote, Notion or Google Keep.

Coucal can also manage notes and synchronize with popular note-taking applications. Notably you can
use Coucal to manage the lifecycle of documents and other artefacts through journaling, which is
becoming increasingly important as the volume of our personal data increases. Historically this was
a concern only for organizations, but personal archiving and journaling is a concern we all now face.

Coucal can connect with digital storage providers for archiving files, as well as providing a managed
lifecycle of artefacts that may also be shared with collaborators.
