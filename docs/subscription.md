## Overview

A Subscription tracks an external source of content and rules defining how such content should be ingested.

For example, a public event may include links to a Websub hub providing event updates. Using a subscription you may
register as a subscriber with the published hub, and indicate content updates should be saved to a "public"
repository in the workspace.

## Invitation

To provide temporary access to subscribe to workspace content, an Invitation may be sent to one or more recipients.
An Invitation allows access to subscribe to a Channel for designated recipients until the specified expiry date.

For example, you may create a new public event that you then want to share with a mailing list. An Invitation can
be used to send the event with encapsulated subscriber information that can then be used to subscribe to content
via the published Websub Hub.
