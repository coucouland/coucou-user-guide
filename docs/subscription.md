## Subscription

A Subscription defines the delivery rules for content published via a Channel. Once again to use the email analogy,
Subscriptions are like the contact list, where you may find the address of well-known collaborators. But a Subscription
also includes rules about the content that is published, and how or where to deliver it.

A Subscription SHOULD support the follow features:

* Define one or more recipient addresses for published content.
* Define rules to match published content that will trigger delivery to recipients.
