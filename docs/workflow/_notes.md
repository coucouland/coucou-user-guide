# Coucal Workflow

* Coucal offers a decentralized approach to workflows, which can become difficult to maintain when
managed centrally.
* In Coucal, workflows are associated with Workspaces, which are typically scoped to a single team
or function
* Workflows involving multiple teams are the result of chaining multiple Workspace automations
(e.g. a new request in one Workspace can trigger creation of an approval in a different Workspace, etc.)
