## Overview

Each verified user on the Coucal platform is allocated their own Workspace. This is where they can access subscribed
content and create new content. A Workspace is analogous to an email Inbox, where you are able to send and receive
email messages. However, Coucal is not like email in that there is no explicit sender or recipient of content. Rather,
content is published and consumed (via subscriptions).
