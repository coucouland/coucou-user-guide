## Overview

Each verified user on the Coucal platform is allocated their own Workspace. This is where they can access subscribed
content and create new content. A Workspace is analogous to an email Inbox, where you are able to send and receive
email messages. However, Coucal is not like email in that there is no explicit sender or recipient of content. Rather,
content is published and consumed (via subscriptions).

## User

Each User is provided with their own default Workspace upon email verification. In this Workspace, Users
may create one or more Repositories for content management.

## Team

Every Team shares a Workspace used to collaborate on resources and content. Team administrators manage
Repositories for shared content. Depending on permissions, Team members can contribute and view content
in selected Repositories.

Teams are hierarchical and may be nested in other Teams. This means that all Users in a nested Team will
inherit the permissions that the Team is granted within the parent Team.
