## Overview

Each verified user on the Coucal platform is provided with their own private Workspace. This is where they can access
subscribed content and create new content. A Workspace is analogous to an email Inbox, where you are able to send and
receive email messages. However, Coucal is not like email in that there is no explicit sender or recipient of content. 
Rather, content is published and consumed (via subscriptions).

## User

Each User is provided with their own private Workspace upon email verification. In this Workspace, Users
may create one or more Repositories for content management.

## Shared Workspaces

Users may also create additional Workspaces and share them with collaborators.
Workspace administrators manage Repositories for shared content. Depending on permissions, 
Workspace members can contribute and view content in selected Repositories.
